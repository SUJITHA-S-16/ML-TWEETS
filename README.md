<b>Procedure:</b>
1. Convert the CSV file to the panda data frame.
  
2. Convert the text to the following.
    • Bag of Words
   
    • TF-IDF

4. For the obtained features, apply the following methods of prediction.

    • Decision Trees

    • Naive Bayes Model
   
    • K-NN Classifier
   
    • SVM

5. For each of this method produce the following metrics:

    • Precision, Recall, F1 - Score
   
    • Confusion Matrix
   
    • RoC - AUC curve
